Been a hard day of analysis? In the lab? Programming Shiny apps? Making 
data visualizations? Maybe you just finished your defense and want to go 
celebrate. Either way, you need a cold one, and you need it now. The pbr package
makes it easy for you to find the closest place to get an ice cold brew. Simply 
use the pbr_me function along with your ZIP code or city name and 
a dynamic map will appear with the nearest places to find one.

```{r pbr_me, eval = FALSE}
pbr_me("Milwaukee, WI")
```

ZIP codes are perhaps a bit more dependable

```{r pbr_me_zip, eval = FALSE}
pbr_me(53210)
```

\

# PBR me ASAP

Need a cold brew now and it just can't wait? Are you too thirsty to remember what 
your ZIP code or current location is? No problem...just pbr_me_asap.

```{r pbr_me_asap, eval = FALSE}
pbr_me_asap()
```



```{r milwaukee_pbr, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8}
format_leaf_lab <- function(name, address, city, state, zip) {
  out <- paste(
    "<strong>", name, "</strong>",
    "<br>",
    address,
    "<br>",
    paste0(city, ", ", state, " ", zip)
  )
  return(lapply(out, htmltools::HTML))
}
leaflet::leaflet(data = milwaukee) |>
  leaflet::addTiles() |>
  leaflet::addMarkers(
    ~lon, ~lat,
    label = ~format_leaf_lab(name, address, city, state, zip)
  )
